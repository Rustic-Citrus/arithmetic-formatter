## Introduction

This is a simple Python function that takes a list of addition or subtraction problems containing two operands each, then prints the equation to the command line in the traditional vertical layout. For example, the format of the input string could be, "134 + 21" or "308 - 75", but not "500 + 200 + 437". Additionally, the function takes an optional second boolean argument to determine whether the equation should show the solution. 

This project is part of the Scientific Computing with Python course on freeCodeCamp. For more information, click on [this link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter) to visit the assignment prompt.

## Getting Started

### Setup

To test that this function works, you will need to have access to a command-line interface and the internet. Also, you will need to have Python and Git installed on your machine.

### Running the application

1. Clone the project to your local machine. This will create a copy of the repository on your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rustic-Citrus/arithmetic-formatter.git
```

2. Next, make sure you are in the correct directory. You will probably have to change directory:

```bash
cd arithmetic-formatter
```

3. Run the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Instructions

Follow the instructions in the command line interface when running the application.

The application will automatically run a series of tests provided by freeCodeCamp to demonstrate that it meets the requirements for the activity, but there is an input prompt afterwards that allows you to test the function yourself.
